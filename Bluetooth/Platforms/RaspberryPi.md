# Controlling GoPro from RaspberryPi over Bluetooth

In order to connect to GoPro over Bluetooth, you need Raspberry Pi with Bluetooth Low Energy support, meaning Rasperry Pi 3, 3+ or Zero W, possibly other older models with working Bluetooth 4.0+ dongle.

GoPro needs to be paired at least with one device to turn the wireless (including Bluetooth) on.

Following procedure was tested on Raspberry Pi Zero W with Raspbian Stretch (release 2018-04-18) and GoPro HERO5 with FW 2.60.

## How to

First step is to prepare Raspberry. If you already have Raspbian set up, you can skip to the next section

1. Download latest [Raspbian Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)

2. Flash it onto SD card using [Etcher](https://etcher.io)

3. After flashing, create `ssh` file in the root of the SD card (volume _boot_) to enable ssh access:

    ```shell
    cd /Volumes/boot/
    touch ssh
    ```

4. Turn on Raspberry and SSH into it (default username `pi`, password `raspberry`)

5. Better to upgrade:

    ```shell
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade -y
    sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
    sudo rpi-update
    sudo reboot
    ```


Now it's time to connect Raspberry to GoPro.


6. Put GoPro into pairing mode (Connect new device > GoPro App)

7. Run:

   ```shell
   sudo bluetoothctl
   ```

8. Scan for devices:

   ```shell
   scan on
   ```
   and after a while, you should see GoPro's Bluetooth address (among others):

   ```shell
   Discovery started
   [CHG] Controller B8:27:EB:E2:EB:2D Discovering: yes
   [NEW] Device DE:71:28:EE:A7:FD GoPro 2495
   ```

9. Now we need to pair GoPro with Raspberry. Replace with your GoPro's Bluetooth address and run:

   ```shell
   trust DE:71:28:EE:A7:FD
   ```
   
   then you should see:
   
   ```shell
    [CHG] Device DE:71:28:EE:A7:FD Trusted: yes
    Changing DE:71:28:EE:A7:FD trust succeeded
   ```

10. Run (again replace):
  
    ```shell
    pair DE:71:28:EE:A7:FD
    ```
    
    then you should see something like this:
    
    ```shell
    Attempting to pair with E6:2A:02:F5:C3:00
    [CHG] Device DE:71:28:EE:A7:FD Connected: yes
    [CHG] Device DE:71:28:EE:A7:FD Paired: yes
    Pairing successful
    ```

Now GoPro is paired with Raspberry. Now you can try to wake up your GoPro over Bluetooth.

11. Turn off the GoPro, then run (putting in your Bluetooth address):
  
    ```shell
    connect DE:71:28:EE:A7:FD
    ```
    
    and GoPro should wake up and light up the display

Let's continue and try controlling GoPro over Bluetooth.

12. Disconnect from the GoPro and exit  `bluetoothctl` utility:

    ```shell
    disconnect
    exit
    ```

13. Run:

    ```shell
    sudo gatttool -t random -b DE:71:28:EE:A7:FD -I
    ```

    – don't forget to replace the Bluetooth address.

14. Try to connect:

    ```shell
    connect
    ```

    and you should see:

    ```shell
    Attempting to connect to DE:71:28:EE:A7:FD
    Connection successful
    ```

15. Now try to run:

    ```shell
    char-write-req 2f 03160101
    ```

    and GoPro should start beeping – you've just turned on the locate function over Bluetooth!

16. To stop beeping, run:

    ```shell
    char-write-req 2f 03160100
    ```

But probably what you want the most is ability to turn on the WiFi over Bluetooth.

17. In that case, just run:

    ```shell
    char-write-req 2f 03170101
    ```

    to turn the WiFi on and

    ```shell
    char-write-req 2f 03170100
    ```

    to turn the WiFi off.

This is just a first try to control GoPro over the WiFi.
