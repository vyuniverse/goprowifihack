This is a community effort to document the API calls between GoPro cameras and GoPro's Smartphone App via WiFi. It has 4 sections for each camera model:

- WiFi commands: a list of WiFi commands you can use for the camera.
- Livestreaming: methods of getting a live video feed off the camera.
- Media Browsing: Instructions on getting media off the SD card via wifi.
- Camera Status: List of camera status meanings

Note: HERO4 camera is now the _base_ for the future API, since the calls will be the same for HERO4 and above.

### Does GoPro offer an official API, SDK or mobile library?

They did offer a mobile library - [but they shut it down](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16189633). This repository will continue to be updated until GoPro stops releasing cameras and ceases operations.

### Libraries:

### Bluetooth:

Bluetooth is used to turn camera on after WiFi AP is disabled in deep sleep, as well as for turning on/off wifi.

- and finally GoPro for allowing us to tinker with their cameras and not shutting down this unofficial API like instagram or snapchat, that means a lot.
